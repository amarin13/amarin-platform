YONDR started as a hypothesis: _What if we designed a product from pure first principles, documenting every architectural decision along the way?_

The goal wasn't just to build something. It was to **study** how products are built.

## Architectural Decisions

### Decision 1: Core Entity Model

Every product needs a core entity model. The entities you choose constrain everything that follows.

**Options considered:**

- User-centric model
- Content-centric model
- Activity-centric model

**Decision:** Activity-centric with user context

**Why:** Activities are the atomic unit of value. Users and content are context.

### Decision 2: Information Architecture

How should information be organized?

**Principle applied:** Progressive disclosure

Users see what they need, when they need it. Complexity exists but doesn't overwhelm.

```
Level 1: Primary actions (always visible)
Level 2: Secondary context (on hover/focus)
Level 3: Full detail (on drill-down)
```

### Decision 3: Feedback Loop Design

Three intentional loops were designed:

1. **Usage → Personalization Loop**

   - Capture: Interaction patterns
   - Apply: Surface relevant content
   - Measure: Engagement depth

2. **Creation → Discovery Loop**

   - Capture: Content metadata
   - Apply: Recommendation engine
   - Measure: Creator growth

3. **Learning → Improvement Loop**
   - Capture: User struggles
   - Apply: UX refinements
   - Measure: Task completion rates

## Tradeoffs Made

Every architecture involves tradeoffs:

| Chose       | Over         | Because                  |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Simplicity  | Features     | Cognitive load matters   |
| Speed       | Completeness | Fast feedback wins       |
| Flexibility | Optimization | Early stage uncertainty  |
| Clarity     | Cleverness   | Teams need to understand |

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Architecture Emerges

The initial architecture was 60% right. The rest emerged from building and learning.

### 2. Documentation Pays Off

Decisions documented early saved countless hours of re-discussion.

### 3. Constraints Liberate

Saying "we won't do X" freed energy for what mattered.

### 4. Measurement is Architecture

The metrics we chose shaped the product as much as the features.

## What's Next

This case study is ongoing. As the product evolves, so does our understanding of what works.
