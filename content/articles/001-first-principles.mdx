# First Principles Thinking in Product Design

Most products are built by analogy. We look at what competitors do, what "best practices" dictate, and what worked for someone else. Then we copy.

**This is why most products fail.**

## The Problem with Building by Analogy

When you build by analogy, you inherit assumptions. Some of those assumptions made sense for the original context. Many don't make sense for yours.

- Slack copied IRC's concept of channels — but reimagined everything else from first principles
- Notion didn't copy Word or Evernote — they asked "what is a block of content?"
- Linear didn't copy Jira — they asked "what does a great issue tracker feel like?"

## What First Principles Thinking Actually Means

First principles thinking means:

1. **Identify your fundamental truths** — What do you know to be absolutely true about your problem space?
2. **Question every assumption** — Why does it have to work this way?
3. **Rebuild from the ground up** — Design the solution that your truths demand

## A Practical Framework

When designing any product system, ask:

```
What problem are we actually solving?
Who experiences this problem?
What would a perfect solution look like if we had no constraints?
What constraints are real vs. inherited?
```

The answers will be different from what you assumed.

## The Payoff

Products built from first principles:

- **Scale differently** — because they're designed for their specific context
- **Compete differently** — because they're not playing the same game
- **Evolve differently** — because they understand their own foundations
