# Product Architecture: The Layer Before Features

There's a layer of product design that most teams skip entirely.

They go straight from "user problem" to "feature solution." The backlog fills up. Sprints fly by. Features ship.

And yet, the product feels... incoherent.

## Features vs. Architecture

A **feature** solves a user problem.

A **product architecture** defines:

- How features relate to each other
- How the product grows over time
- How teams make decisions
- How value compounds

Think of it this way:

| Features             | Architecture                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| What users see       | What makes the product coherent |
| Individual solutions | Systemic patterns               |
| Shipped in sprints   | Evolves over years              |
| Designed by PMs      | Designed by architects          |

## Signs You're Missing Architecture

- Features feel disconnected
- Every new capability requires rethinking everything
- Teams have different mental models of the product
- Growth creates chaos instead of leverage
- Technical debt accumulates faster than value

## The Architecture Layer

Product architecture answers questions like:

1. **Information Architecture** — How is data organized and related?
2. **Interaction Patterns** — What are the consistent ways users interact?
3. **Extension Model** — How do new capabilities plug in?
4. **Scale Patterns** — What happens when usage 10x?
5. **Value Model** — How does user action create business value?

## Example: Notion's Architecture

Notion's architecture is built on a single concept: **everything is a block**.

This one decision:

- Unifies pages, databases, embeds, and content
- Makes the product infinitely extensible
- Creates a consistent mental model
- Enables features they haven't built yet

That's architecture.

## Designing Architecture

Before building features, define:

```
Core Concepts — What are the 3-5 fundamental entities?
Relationships — How do they connect?
Patterns — What interactions repeat?
Constraints — What will you NOT do?
```

The best architectures are discovered, not invented. They emerge from understanding the problem deeply.
