# Feedback Loops: The Engine of Product Growth

The best products don't just solve problems. They get better at solving problems the more they're used.

This isn't magic. It's **feedback loop design**.

## What is a Feedback Loop?

A feedback loop is a system where outputs become inputs:

```
User Action → System Response → Learning → Better System → Better User Action
```

Every product has feedback loops. The question is whether they're:

- **Intentional** or accidental
- **Positive** (amplifying) or negative (dampening)
- **Fast** or slow
- **Measurable** or invisible

## Types of Product Feedback Loops

### 1. Data Loops

More usage → More data → Better product → More usage

_Example: Spotify's Discover Weekly gets better as you listen more._

### 2. Network Loops

More users → More value → More users

_Example: Slack channels become more valuable as more people join._

### 3. Content Loops

More content → More discovery → More creators → More content

_Example: YouTube's recommendation engine feeds creator growth._

### 4. Learning Loops

More usage → More insights → Better decisions → Better product

_Example: Product analytics driving feature prioritization._

## Designing Intentional Loops

For each feedback loop, define:

| Element     | Question                               |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Trigger** | What user action starts the loop?      |
| **Capture** | What data do we collect?               |
| **Process** | How do we transform data into insight? |
| **Apply**   | How does insight improve the product?  |
| **Measure** | How do we know the loop is working?    |

## The Compounding Effect

Products with strong feedback loops don't grow linearly. They compound.

- **Year 1**: Building the loops
- **Year 2**: Loops start working
- **Year 3**: Loops accelerate each other
- **Year 4+**: Competitive moats form

This is why some products become unbeatable. Their feedback loops have compounded for years.

## Common Mistakes

1. **No measurement** — Loops you can't measure, you can't improve
2. **Too slow** — If the loop takes months, users forget
3. **No value** — Collecting data without creating user value
4. **Single loop** — The best products have multiple reinforcing loops

## The Architecture of Growth

Feedback loops aren't features. They're architecture.

Design them before you build. Measure them from day one. Optimize them forever.

_At AMARIN, we design feedback loops as first-class architectural elements. Because without them, products don't compound — they decay._
